Description:

This application was created to organize the company Horiseon's company page. It was organized in such a way that I gave it semantic language as to be easier to maintain and left notes describing the changes made so that future developers can interpret my changes in a simpler way.




[Here's a look at the layout of the website]

As well as the actual website itself:

https://msteven5.github.io/code-refactor-1/

Note: All work done was created through the Visual Studio Code program and coded by myself with HTML, CSS, git, and resources provided by GitHub. All coding done in the main "index.html" file located in the root of the GitHub repo as well as the "style.css" in the assets/css/style.css file also located in the main root of the Github repo.
